# i3wm
This repo is to keep my dotfiles on i3wm.  This is not any tutorial or somethig like that.

## Why
Well I'm not any linux expert or wm expert but this repo is to show the beauty of the WM, even though I'm on linux around five months now and WM around three I suppose. I'm delighted that I got into it. I just wanted to share my configs you can use it the way you want. I expecially give my thanks to Derek Taylor from DistroTube and Marcos Oliveira from TerminalRoot, those guys are the best.
###### BTW, I'm rookie here so any mistake that I've made, just dont make it offensive. cool?
